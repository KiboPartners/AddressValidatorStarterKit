# TypeScript Arc Starter Kit

Define your functions in `src/main.ts`. Export your Action name.

First install the dependencies with: `npm install`
Then build with `grunt`. It will run through eslint and Typescript checks, compile the code into the assets folder, and then upload to your application using mozusync as usual.
